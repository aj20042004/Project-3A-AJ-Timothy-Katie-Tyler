# Binary Tree Infix Expression Parser

Overview:
- This project aims to implement an infix expression parser in C++ using stacks. The parser will be capable of evaluating arithmetic and logical expressions efficiently.

Technical Requirements:
- Parse infix expressions with support for arithmetic and logical operators with the specified precedencies.
- Handle operator precedence according to specified rules.
- Parse an expression given in a string format. The program should be flexible with the given expressions. The user should not worry about writing the spaces between operands and operators.
- Evaluate expressions efficiently.
- The main() program should read expressions from an input file, and then output the evaluation results to the console.
- Provide error handling for invalid expressions or divide-by-zero errors.

Implementation:
- The implementation will involve creating classes for expression parsing, evaluation, and error handling. The project will adhere to Object-Oriented Programming principles for better organization and scalability.

How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
- Run the compiled program and provide input expressions to evaluate.

Contributing:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Make your changes and test thoroughly.
- Submit a pull request detailing your changes.
